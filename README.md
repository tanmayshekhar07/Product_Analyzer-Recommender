# Product_Recommendation_System

This project focuses on building a robust Product Recommendation System, paired with a detailed Sentiment Analysis of each product. It's designed to offer insightful product recommendations to users while analyzing customer sentiments associated with each product.

## Project Overview

The system is developed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The primary objectives of the project include:

### Product Recommendation: 
Utilize collaborative filtering and other advanced techniques to recommend products to users.
Sentiment Analysis: Perform an in-depth sentiment analysis on product reviews to gauge customer satisfaction and preferences.
Repository Structure

### Final.ipynb: 
This Jupyter Notebook contains the core logic of the project. It involves steps like data preprocessing, model building for the recommendation system, and sentiment analysis algorithms.
app.py: A Streamlit-based web application that allows users to interact with the recommendation system and view sentiment analysis results.
Key Features

### Recommendation Engine: 
The system recommends products based on user preferences and historical data, using techniques like cosine similarity.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes customer reviews to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) towards each product.
Interactive Web Application: Built using Streamlit, this application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the recommendation system and viewing sentiment analysis.
Technologies Used

Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data manipulation and visualization.
Scikit-learn, NLTK: For building the recommendation model and performing sentiment analysis.
Streamlit: For creating the web application.
Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook (Final.ipynb) to understand the logic behind the recommendation system and sentiment analysis.
Launch the Streamlit app (app.py) to interact with the system.
Usage

Use the Final.ipynb notebook for a detailed walkthrough of the data processing, model building, and analysis phases.
Launch the Streamlit app for a practical application of the recommendation system and sentiment analysis.
